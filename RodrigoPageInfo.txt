SITE STRUCTURE & DESIGN NOTES (for rebuilding)
The current site is built on Wix with a dark green/black theme and a distinctive retro monospace font for the header. It has a flat structure: homepage → 5 collection categories → individual project pages. Each project page uses a consistent template with title, project type tags, date, location, description paragraphs, and a photo gallery. The footer has social links and email. There's also a blog section with 3 generic Spanish-language posts about engineering portfolios. The site is bilingual (Spanish navigation labels, English content).
